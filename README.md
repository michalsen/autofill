AutoFill

Autofilling Wordpress content since 1975.

Good news everybody! Autofill for everywhere.

Suck it Trebek.


Just add the shortcode [autofill] to any page or post to see how
it DOESN"T work.

Yep, not going to work for you right now. Why? because the taxonomy/category and
content type are all hard coded for a clients custom needs.

Hardcoded??? What, are you some type of nihilist?
No. I just don't have time right now to make do what you want it to do.
But give me a little time. I'll get it.

And then there will be much rejoicing.
yeah.
